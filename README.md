Lake Nasser MODIS Image Time Series Project
Project Overview

This project uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) and MODIS satellite data to analyze and visualize changes around Lake Nasser over time. By generating a time series of satellite images from 2000 to 2023, the project processes and creates a video, as well as a GIF, to visually capture environmental changes in the region. The goal is to provide insights into long-term environmental trends using satellite imagery data.
Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.x
    Google Earth Engine (GEE) API
    geemap library
    pandas
    numpy
    os
    datetime

You can install the required libraries using the following pip commands:

pip install pandas numpy geemap earthengine-api

Setup and Authentication
Step 1: Earth Engine Authentication

To authenticate with Google Earth Engine (GEE), run the following commands in your Python environment:

import ee
ee.Authenticate()
ee.Initialize(project='#')

This will open a link in your browser where you will need to sign in and paste the authentication token back into the command line.
Step 2: Configure Project Parameters

The script defines the location of Lake Nasser, the time range from 2000 to 2023, and a list of MODIS satellite image collections. The location of Lake Nasser is set using the following coordinates:

    Latitude: 22.833
    Longitude: 32.500

Project Description

Image Collection: The script collects MODIS images from the MODIS/061/MOD09GA dataset, focusing on the RGB bands (sur_refl_b02, sur_refl_b04, sur_refl_b03). The images are filtered over the specified geographical region (Lake Nasser area) and time range.

Time Series Creation: The script generates a time series of these images, covering the period from January 1, 2000, to August 1, 2023. The images are processed with predefined visual parameters to enhance image quality.

 GIF Generation: The script generates a GIF that visualizes the changes over time, showing the images sequentially with date labels.

Saving Results: All generated images and the final GIF are saved to the specified output directory.


## GIF Visualization

The GIF generated by the project provides a visual representation of the environmental changes around Lake Nasser from 2000 to 2023. It shows the transformation of the region over time with labeled dates.

Here is a preview of the generated GIF:

Conclusion

This project provides an effective way to visualize and analyze environmental changes using satellite imagery. By leveraging the power of Google Earth Engine, the project allows for the processing of large datasets and the creation of compelling visualizations. The generated GIF offers valuable insights into long-term environmental trends around Lake Nasser
